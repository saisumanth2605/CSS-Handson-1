        <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
        <ol class="list1">
          <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
          <li>
            CSS describe how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,Paper,or in
            other media
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="a"> Css is not necessary.</span>
            <span class="c">CSS saves lot of work</span> and can control the kayout
            of multiple web pages all at once
          </li>
          <li id="a"><i>Extrenl style sheets are sorted in CSS files.</i></li>
        </ol>
        <br />
        <h3>CSS can be added to HTML Document in 3 ways:</h3>
        <ul class="list2" type="disc">
          <li>Inline- by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
          <li>Internal- by using style element in head section of the HTML file</li>
          <li>External- by using style element to link to a external CSS file.</li>
    
          <li>
            The most common way to add CSS. is to keep the styles in external CSS
            files. However,<span class="c">
              in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles.</span
            >, because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it
            yourself.
          </li>
          <br />
        </ul>
        <p>
          When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a
          style to multiple elements. ID. on the other hand, applies a style to one
          unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to
          link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of
          elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set
          of styles can be applied to the element.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a wide range of
          selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both
          are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.
